# Contributing

Your contributions are welcome!

## Guidelines

* Add a section if needed and add the section title to the Table of contents.
* Follow the notations and conventions already adopted.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure it's relevant for post-scarcity. For instance, deep learning or hydrogen cars are too narrow topics to be relevant alone, while AGI or fusion energy may be big individual contributors.
* Quality > Quantity. Insert only resources that you would personally recommend. 
* Send a Pull Request.
